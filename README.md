# Checkpoint-Algorithms-and-its-elements
This is an algorithm that reads a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:
- The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
- The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
- The number of vowels in the sentence.


Keeping in mind that: 
- Each character will be treated separately.
- The last character is the point.
- Use three variables as counters.
